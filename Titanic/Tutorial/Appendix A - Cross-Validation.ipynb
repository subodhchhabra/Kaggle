    "Suppose we don't have access to the Kaggle leaderboard, we still have means to check how well we're doing with cross-validation. The process is as follows: we divide the data set into two, using the first to train our model and the second to make predictions. Since we have the actual outcomes in the second data set, we can use this as a basis of comparison and calculate the accuracy of our predictions. Dividing the data set into two is called 2-fold cross-validation, with each fold being the individual partitions of the data set. "
